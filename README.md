# word2Vector


This repository contains an implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm, a popular technique for learning word embeddings using shallow neural networks. The project demonstrates how to train Word2Vec models, including both Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram architectures, and how to use the learned embeddings for downstream natural language processing tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, or word similarity tasks.

Project Overview
Word2Vec is a method for creating word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space. This project involves training Word2Vec models on text data to capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. Word2Vec models are widely used in NLP tasks to convert textual data into numerical format that machine learning models can work with.

Key Features:
Implementation of both CBOW and Skip-Gram architectures.
Ability to train on any textual dataset.
Evaluation of learned word vectors using similarity metrics.
Visualization of word embeddings using t-SNE or PCA.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install Python and the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy gensim matplotlib nltk scikit-learn
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word2vec-project.git
cd word2vec-project
Usage
To train the Word2Vec model, simply run the train_word2vec.py script with your input dataset:

bash
Copy code
python train_word2vec.py --input_file data/corpus.txt --model_type cbow --vector_size 100 --window 5 --min_count 2
Command Line Arguments:
--input_file: Path to the input text corpus.
--model_type: Choose between cbow or skipgram model (default: cbow).
--vector_size: Dimension of the word vectors (default: 100).
--window: Context window size (default: 5).
--min_count: Minimum word frequency for a word to be included in the vocabulary (default: 2).
Example:
bash
Copy code
python train_word2vec.py --input_file data/sample_text.txt --model_type skipgram --vector_size 300 --window 10 --min_count 5
Once the model is trained, the word vectors will be saved to the models/ directory. You can then use these vectors for various downstream tasks.

Dataset
To train the Word2Vec model, you need a large corpus of text. You can use any text dataset, such as:

Wikipedia Dumps: A common dataset for learning word embeddings.
Text8 Dataset: A small dataset derived from Wikipedia for Word2Vec.
Custom Dataset: You can train the model on any domain-specific dataset you want to explore.
Place your dataset in the data/ directory before running the training script.

Word2Vec Architectures
The project supports two key architectures of Word2Vec:

1. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)
Description: Predicts the target word based on the context words around it.
Use Case: Works well when you have a larger dataset and are more interested in frequent words.
2. Skip-Gram
Description: Predicts the context words given a target word.
Use Case: Works better for smaller datasets or when you want to learn representations for rare words.
Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using Gensim's Word2Vec implementation. The training process can be customized by adjusting the vector size, window size, and other hyperparameters. During training, the following key components are optimized:

Word Vector Quality: Assessed by similarity between words based on cosine similarity.
Training Time: Dependent on the size of the corpus and chosen hyperparameters.
After training, you can evaluate word similarities using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py --model_path models/word2vec.model --word1 king --word2 queen
This will output the similarity score between two words based on the learned embeddings.

Results
Once training is complete, you can visualize the word embeddings using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or PCA:

bash
Copy code
python visualize_embeddings.py --model_path models/word2vec.model --words 'king queen man woman'
Example Results:
Similarity Example:

similarity("king", "queen") = 0.85
similarity("man", "woman") = 0.76
t-SNE Visualization:

A 2D or 3D plot showing clusters of semantically related words.
Embedding Visualizations:
You can view the word clusters in the form of 2D plots, showcasing how semantically similar words are grouped together.
